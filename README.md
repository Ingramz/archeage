# ArcheAge projects

ArcheAge service in EU/NA by Kakao Games was [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20240425135841/https://archeage.playkakaogames.com/news/3136) to be terminated on June 27 2024, which effectively marks the end of my involvement in the game. This repository contains a selection of projects created and knowledge gathered during the time when I was actively playing.

I do not intend to maintain these projects any further, feel free to do so yourself. The information provided here is effectively released into public domain, however I do ask politely to be credited for any contributions whenever applicable.

For questions, issues and discussions, please use the [issues](https://github.com/Ingramz/archeage/issues) section. For private inquiries, you can find my email address from commit messages or add me on Discord: [`0x496e6772616d`](https://discord.com/users/168034266741997568).
